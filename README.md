For this project, I created a C99 library for solving linear equations of the form Ax = b using
LU factorization with partial pivoting. The goal is to produce a largely self-contained
library that other software can use to solve problems.

"LUfact.c" -- Project implementation<br />
"LUfact.h" -- Header file<br />
"LUtest.c" -- Testing bank<br />
